    <p>The players can choose whether to flip the coin or not,</p>
    <p>but they DON'T GET TO SEE THE OUTCOME.</p>
    <p>Each player has two chances to flip the coin or not.</p>
    <p>Wait, did you say "Who plays first?"</p>
    <p>Oh, That's a great question. The computer plays first!</p>
    <p>After these four rounds, the system will reveal the coin.</p>
    <p>And if it is Heads, then you win.</p>
    <p>But if the coin is Tails, then you lose.</p>
    <p>Simple, right?</p>

    <h3>New! A Wizard!</h3>
    <p>Now, there's a wizard to tell you the state of the coin <br> after the computer makes its choice! <br> But he is not a <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Alastor_Moody">Mad-Eye Moody</a>. <br> He is more like a Ron with his <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Charles_Weasley%27s_wand">broken wand</a>. <br> At first, the wizard can tell you the right state of the coin with 60% of confidence. <br> But, the wizard can tell you the right sate of the coin <br> with 55% of confidence in his second try.</p>
